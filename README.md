!Introduce yourself! Include your pronouns so that your teammates know whichpronouns to use. This could also be a good place for a name pronunciation guide.
## Who am I?
### Non-work
Who are you outside of work? This could include things like which city you live in, yourhobbies and interests, or quirks about you that your teammates might not immediately guess.
### Work
Tell your future teammates about you at work. What is your career background like, andwhat are your career interests? What are your skills? What are a few of your biggest strengths? 
You’ll go into more detail later in the document.
## Goals
### Learning goals
What do you want to learn? For example — if you are a software developer and want tolearn more about a particular area in software,
like performance or security, let yourteam know that. This could help your project lead assign you tasks that fit your goals.
### Career goals
What are your career goals? If you want to grow into a certain role or area at yourorganization, why not let people know that? At 18F, many of us are in term-limitedpositions, 
which can make it easier for us to talk about career goals after our time at18F. Writing these out can be hard, but if you feel comfortable letting your team knowabout your career goals, 
they can think of you for future opportunities.
## You can lean on me to ...

If you find it hardto come up with examples here, why not ask a former teammate or supervisor?
## How to support me as we work together
What are your growing edges? Are there areas you’ve noticed where you could useextra support? 
Again, if you find it hard to come up with examples here, you could aska former teammate or supervisor.## How to support me as a personThis section requires a degree of trust. 
It’s up to you if you want to include this sectionor not, and what you want to put here.People have different needs. 
Work isn’t the only responsibility on our shoulders,whether we’re caring for children or for elderly parents, or dealing with illness or otherlife stressors. 
While you don’t need to share all the details — or any details — with yourcoworkers, consider letting them know how they can support you if you feelcomfortable.
Examples: “I generally need to take a quick break from work on these days of the weekto pick up my kids from the bus stop.” 
Or: “I have an allergy to gluten — if we go out forlunch as a team, let’s make sure that we pick somewhere with good gluten-freeoptions.”
Your teammates can help and support you when they know what you need, and thissection gives them that chance.
## Ways of working together
What practices did you find effective in past work experiences? Maybe you have afavorite way to run team meetings, or a favorite method for team decision-making.
This section is a chance to share those practices up-front with your team.## Teamwork preferencesHow do you tend to work on teams? Do you need a push to speak up in group settings,
or do you need a prompt to step back and make more room for others? Do youappreciate when teammates ask for your opinions in meetings, or does that make youfeel put on the spot?
## Technical preferences
Share your favorite technical tools, frameworks, choices and approaches in this section,if applicable.## Feedback preferencesHow do you like to receive feedback?
 Do you prefer feedback in writing (email, Slack),over video call, or in-person if possible? Does it take you a while to process feedback?How do you prefer to get positive feedback versus constructive feedback?
 Giving and receiving feedback is essential to good teamwork, and giving and receiving
 feedback can also be very hard to do well. Make it as easy as possible for yourteammates to give you feedback by letting them know your preferences.
